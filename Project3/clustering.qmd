## Introduction & Data

This project aims to explore the potential groups between pizza places within the United States. Variables such as location, rating, and price level can create natural groups amongst the restaurants depending on cluster characteristics.

The original dataset is from Jared Lander and Barstool Sports via Tyler Richards, and can be found under the tidytuesday GitHub repository. The preprocessed data contains 452 different pizza places across the United States.

### Key variables of interest:

-   'latitude' : Latitude coordinate of pizza place
-   'longitude' : Longitude coordinate of pizza place
-   'review_stats_all_average_score' : Average score
-   'review_stats_community_average_score' : Community average score
-   'price_level' : Price rating (fewer \$ = cheaper)

### Research Question:

What natural patterns emerge amongst pizza places and their locations in relation to ratings and price levels?

### EDA

In the initial EDA, bivariate analysis was done to see potential relationships between community average score (range1:8) in relation to price level (range 0:3). It was found that the community average score was the highest (6) at a price level of 2.

## Methodology

Clustering is the chosen method to analyze this data due to its ability to find hidden patterns amongst variables. This method of analysis can uncover natural groupings between pizza places and their ratings in relation to location.

FCPS is the specific clustering package used to analyze this dataset. This package contains a wide variety of conventional clustering algorithms.

## Analysis

The analysis only refers to this specific dataset and cannot be generalized to all pizza places in the US. This dataset reflects heavily on reviews and opinions, which can be heavily biased by emotion, varying levels of reviewer standards, and other outside factors. While reading the analysis, it is important to remember that these results are not definitive, especially with the nature of the data.

### 1.  Price & score across all locations

![](clusterPlots/Cluster1.png)

Cluster 1: High price level, low average score

-   Why? Reviewers may have higher expectations for pricier places.

Cluster 2: Low price level, high average score

-   Why? Reviewers may be less strict with ratings from a cheaper place.

Cluster 3: High price level, high average score

-   Why? Reviewers may have felt that the price of the pizza matched their expectations and standards.

Cluster 4: Low price level, low average score

-   Why? Reviewers may have not had their standards met for a cheap slice.

### 2. Price & longitude

![](clusterPlots/Cluster2.png)

Cluster 1: Low price level, high longitude

-   Why? Pizza places on the west coast have lower prices.

Cluster 2: Average to high price level, low longitude

-   Why? Pizza places further inland and on the east coast tend to have higher prices. There seems to be a couple places that are on the very expensive end, causing a triangle shape at the end of the cluster.

Cluster 3: Average to high price level, high longitude

-   Why? This cluster appears to be a triangular shape. Majority of the points are in the average (1) part of the plot in terms of price, but a few places are on the more expensive side. This could represent the pricier pizza places on the west side of the country.

### 3. Price & score in New York

![](clusterPlots/Cluster3.png)

Cluster 1: High price level, average to high average score

-   Why? Reviewers in New York may be satisfied with their experience at the pizza place in relation to the price.

Cluster 2: Various price levels, low average score

-   Why? The variability of this cluster's prices may be caused by New York reviewers having higher standards. Since New York is known for their pizza, consumers may approach these restaurants with greater expectations than other states. Therefore, the consistent low reviews across all price points may reflect a difference in opinion.

Cluster 3: Low price level, various average scores

-   Why? Similar to the prediction in Cluster 2, this may be caused by varying levels of expectation going into the experience. A regular customer may rate a lower price level restaurant higher than a tourist who is trying it for the first time.

### 4. Price & score outside of New York

![](clusterPlots/Cluster4.png)

Cluster 1: Average to high price level, average to high average score

-   Why? Overall, the main data points are congregated around the 0.75 level of price with one outlier at 2.5. It seems that most of the reviewers in this cluster have generally average ratings for pizza places at average price points.

Cluster 2: Various price levels, low average score

-   Why? This could be because individuals outside of New York may have unequal standards in relation to their experience with the location. However, the consistent low scores could also happen because of a negative experience.

Cluster 3: Low price level, average to high average score

-   Why? This cluster has one outlier marked very low on price and average on score. The rest of the data points indicate that this was a unique experience, since everything else lies in almost 2 levels higher in price with varying scores. This could represent the reviewers who were generally satisfied with their food and experience.
