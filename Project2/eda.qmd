## Statement of Research Question & Analysis Objective

**Research question:** **How do community review scores and all-review scores relate to price level and location across clusters?**

My analysis will consist of the variables 'city', 'price_level', 'review_stats_community_average_score', and 'review_stats_all_average_score'. I am curious to find if there are potential clusters among expensive pizza places and their reviews, or if there are more groupings across cheaper places. Furthermore, I want to research if community reviews are more lenient than the average score of all reviews, potentially due to their loyalty to their community. I predict that there will be more clusters among lower priced restaurants because I expect reviewers to have lower expectations as opposed to pricier options. If possible, I would also like to explore the pizza place's location in relation to their reviews. I predict that the city of New York will have more critical reviews due to their density of pizza places and stricter standards from tourists and locals for the perfect slice.

## Description of the Data

Variables of interest:

'city': City

'price_level': Price rating (fewer \$ = cheaper, more \$\$\$ = expensive)

'review_stats_community_average_score': Community average score

'review_stats_all_average_score': Average score of all reviewers (community, critic, Barstool)
